> Bot tracks curse words, gives warnings and can ban a user. Of course, some users can try to get round the system, however other ones can improve its work and send to the bot bad words, and the system analyzes how many times this word was sent and decides if it is a bad word or not. Additionally, the bot can be loyal and at some time remove all warnings, or an admin can unban banned users by bot or acquit them. Users can also start a poll to ban a specific user(s). 

> Bot uses some patterns for tracking bad words and files with such words.
